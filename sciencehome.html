<h2>Earthquakes</h2>
An earthquake-alo called a <b>quake</b>,<b>tremor</b> or <b>temblor</b> is a sudden and violent shaking of the ground, often caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. These movements release energy in the form of seismic waves, which propagate through the Earth, causing the ground to shake.
